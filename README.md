cornell-beamer
==============

A LaTeX Beamer template for presentations at Cornell University.

Setup
-----

Edit the <code>config/metainfo.tex</code> file to include
* your name,
* the title and subtitle of your presentation and 
* the presentation date.

Compiling the Source Code
-------------------------
Use `pdflatex` and `bibtex` to generate a presentation.
If you prefer the command line you can comfortably run the <code>make</code> script.

* Optional: GNU Make for the compile script.
